        <h2>About the exhibition</h2>
        <p>Metal Morphix brings together the exciting work of Andre Sardone and Noel Muscat. These longtime friends
            inspire each other to push the boundaries of their practice as they explore wasy to morph materials into
            highly expressive sculpture.</p>'s amazing nonsensical objects are compiled of recognisable and juxtaposed
            machinery, industrial parts, laboratory and photographic equipment. His works sits inquisitively alongide
            Andre's as he showcases his recent explorations into innovative techniques for joining, machining and
            milling raw metals, exploring forms inspired by natural seed structures that protect, nurture, and ensure
            the survival of plant species. Together they have created a collection that sparks true curiosity and
            wonder.</p>
